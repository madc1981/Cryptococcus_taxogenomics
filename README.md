# Cryptococcus_taxogenomics

This repository contains all scripts, data files, and output necessary to reproduce the analyses from the study **"Genomic delineation and taxonomic description of new Cryptococcus species"**.

## Repository structure

- `Fig1/`: Phylogenomic trees (ASTRAL, ML) and concordance factors
- `Fig2/`: Genomic similarity metrics (ANI, AAI, dDDH) and correlation analyses
- `Fig4D-G/`: Recombination analyses â€” PCA, LD decay, and four-gamete test
- `Figs3B_and_5A/`: Chromosome synteny and centromere structure plots
- `Figs6_and_S7/`: rRNA gene detection, subtelomeric enrichment, and distribution
- `Figs7_and_S8/`: Phenotypic profiling (Biolog assays)

Each folder includes a `README.md` file explaining the analysis, inputs, outputs, and software dependencies. Where applicable, Conda environments or scripts are provided to reproduce the results.

## Dependencies

Most analyses were performed in a Unix-based environment using Conda-managed packages. Individual folders include environment YAMLs or instructions.
